What is I/O ? What are I/O bound task ?

Ans : An I/O bound task, in the world of computers, is one that's limited by the speed of  input/output (I/O) operations rather than the processing power of the
 central processing unit (CPU).  These tasks spend most of their time waiting for data to be transferred from or to external devices like disks, networks, 
or even user input,  rather than performing calculations.
Here's a breakdown of I/O bound tasks:

a) Focus on data transfer: I/O bound tasks are all about moving data around, not necessarily complex computations.
b) Waiting time is key: The speed of the I/O system dictates how fast the task can be completed. Upgrading the CPU might not help much if the bottleneck is the I/O.
Examples: Downloading a file, copying large amounts of data, or waiting for user input are all common I/O bound tasks.
c) I/O bound tasks are contrasted with CPU bound tasks, which heavily rely on the CPU for processing and can benefit from a faster processor.  Understanding whether
 a task is I/O bound or CPU bound is important for optimizing computer systems and improving performance.
